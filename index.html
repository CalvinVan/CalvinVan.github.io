            <h3>Sophomore College Undergraduate</h3>
            <p>I am currently attending the University of Texas at Dallas and pursuing a Bachorler's Science Degree in Computer Science. 
              I currently have a 4.0 GPA and notable classes that I have taken are Intro to Computer Science, Computer Science I, and 
              Discrete Mathematics I. Notable classes that I will be taking in Fall 2023 include Computer Science II, Computer Architecture, 
              Discrete Math II, and Statistics and Probability for Computer Science. </p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Intern</h3>
            <p>I am finishing up an internship with the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and am located at the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) 
              in Vicksburg, Mississippi. I am involved in researching about machine learning and working with Nvidia DeepStream GStreamer pipelines 
              to figure out its capabilities in deploying inference models that perform segmentation and object detection. 
              My responsibilities entail experimenting and researching about DeepStream pipeline configurations and documenting the challenges and capabilities that come with 
              integrating previously used PyTorch models. </p>

            <h3>"Party Trick" Hobbyist </h3>
            <p>I find it fascinating how as humans we have found a myriad of ways to entertain ourselves and 
              to go even further my creating mastery for these skills. That is one of the main reasons for why I find such great enjoyment from
              one of my hobbies - learning "random" skills.
              Beyond that, I simply enjoy learning these skills because I believe it would be cool to do so and that the process of learning something new brings me a great fulfillment.
              <br><br>
              
              Some skills that I have learned in the past (though many of them to a basic degree) are breakdancing, butterfly knife tricks, beatboxing, juggling,
              and even nunchaku tricks to name a few! As of now and outside of learning programming languages and software, I currently dedicate much of my free time
              in learning how to play volleyball and learning to freeskate!

        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">First-Generation Computer Science Student </p>
        
        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>Growing up, I was always fascinated with technology and how it has changed the world as we know it, and while I admit that my interest 
              was first sparked by cool gadgets such as computers, video game consoles, and smartphones, 
              I was further captivated by the technology that I feel many of us do not appreciate enough - even though 
              they have made our lives more convenient or fundamentally affect how we live day to day.<br><br> 
              For example, take what is my favorite piece of technology and may be what I believe everyone should have - the refrigerator. Of course, it aids us greatly in
              allowing us to preserve our food longer and decreases food waste, but let me take it a step further. My favorite thing about it would be how - with a filter -
              it can instantly provide you clean, cold drinking water, and do not get me started on how incredible it is that we get to have
              convenient access to ice today because of it! To top it all off how else would we have the ability to conventiently store one of the greatest foods to ever exist? Ice Cream!   </p>
            <p>It is because of this fascination that I ultimately decided to major in Computer Science. The notion of knowing that I will get to be part of the world that gets to help create technology that offers such pleasures or even just makes someone's day a bit better is something you cannot find anywhere else and what drew me into this the field that is tehnology .</p>
